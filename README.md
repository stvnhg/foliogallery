============

All credits to [foliopages](http://www.foliopages.com/php-jquery-ajax-photo-gallery-no-database). I used their php script, removed all their html & css styles and modified it to use bootstrap. Also removed paging but might add it back if I would need it.

You can just clone the repository and upload it to your webspace. Make sure the `albums` folder has write access so the script can create the thumbnails.
